## DIY
##### Find an object, spatial detail, or unique surface and write down 5 qualities it has.

Examples:
* Material
* Color
* Shape
* Texture
* Context

…
Now shine a projector onto it

Explore what it means to shine concentrated light onto the object

Make solid background colors and explore how different colors work with the surface and material

Look at the 5 qualities you wrote down and think about how they are affected by the light.

# The basic process

* Identify content / concept

    * What is the content?

        * Videos

        * Images

        * Vector animations

    * What is/are the object(s) you’ll map to?

        * How many surfaces will cover all objects?

        * Is it planar?

        * Is it made up of straight lines?

    * What is the concept?

        * Why are you mapping this object with this content?

* Decide on a technique (or multiple) based on the object(s) to be mapped

    * Quad mapping

    * Masking layers

    * Mesh mapping

# Quad mapping

* Basic idea
    * The corners of a rectangle act as anchor points for rendering a texture onto an object properly.

**See also: ( Processing tutorial: "CornerPin" )**

# Try it yourself
* Go back to the object you chose earlier
* Break it down into quads, as best you can
* Draw the proper quads in Processing and fit them onto the object
* Explore different colors, images, animations

# Quad mapping with multiple quads
**( Max tutorial:"1_Projection Mapping in Jit.World.maxpat")**

# Do it yourself!

HW: Have a look back at the questions and answer them for a piece to be prototyped on Saturday.
